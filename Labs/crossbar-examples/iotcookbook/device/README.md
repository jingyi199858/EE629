# Crossbar.io IoT Cookbook: Devices

This folder contains examples of IoT device WAMP components using features, hardware or extensions specific to popular devices:

* [RaspberryPi Examples](./pi)
* [Arduino Yun Examples](./yun)
* [Tessel Examples](./tessel)

The examples provide basic building blocks which you can use to immediately create complete IoT apps by combining multiple components, write custom backends or your own frontends.

You can also use the examples as a starting point for your own code: all code here is licensed under the MIT open-source license, which permits use in both open- and closed-source projects.
